# **Umbbra RevOps Analytics Project**

A complete data analysis project applying the CRISP-DM methodology to diagnose sales and marketing performance for a fictitious company selling 5 executive training programs.
This project demonstrates how RevOps + Data Science + Python can generate insights, identify commercial bottlenecks, and support strategic decision-making.

## **Stage 1 — Business Understanding (CRISP-DM)**

**Context**

Umbbra was hired to analyze the commercial performance of a fictitious company offering 5 executive training programs.
The company provided 12 months of sales, marketing, and funnel performance data.

The objective is to use Python and RevOps methodologies to:
- Identify bottlenecks in the funnel (Leads → MQL → SQL → Opportunities → Sales)
- Evaluate marketing efficiency (CPL, CAC, investment, pricing)
- Identify top- and low-performing products
- Analyze seasonality and behavioral trends
- Build strategic recommendations to optimize revenue operations

## **Business Objective**

Generate insights capable of:
- Reducing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Increasing conversion across funnel stages
- Revealing products with the highest growth potential
- Creating a foundation for Umbbra’s upsell offer (performance marketing management)

## **Success Criteria**

The project is successful if:
- At least three bottlenecks in the commercial funnel are identified
- Actionable strategic recommendations are created
- Data visualizations clearly communicate findings
- A strong consulting pitch can be delivered to the client
